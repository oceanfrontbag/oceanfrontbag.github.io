# Ocean Front Bag by A. M. Aiken

The Ocean Front Bag was born out of a personal need and a moment of clarity under the sun. While using the Strathmere Weekend Bag by the pool, I realized that although it was perfect for a weekend getaway, its features were overkill for a simple sun-soaked afternoon. Thus, the Ocean Front Bag was conceived—a bag of the same luxurious quality and size, but without the unnecessary extras. Just a few essential pockets and a breezy, open-top design with a snap button closure.

When packing this for the pool I typically pack the following, in an effort to convey what you may be able to fit into yours for your walk up to the pool or beach:

- 3 beach towels
- 2 large 32oz water bottles
- 2 pairs of goggles
- a set of pool rings (for my son to dive for after I throw them into the water)
- snacks (crackers, chips, etc)
- a small pouch which carries my wallet, notebook, pencil, pencil sharpener, house keys, chapstick, and so on. 
- another small pouch for various lotions
- pool passes (in the smaller interior pocket)
- current magazine I’m reading through (in the larger interior pocket)
- current book I’m _trying desperately_ to read through
- phone (in one of the exterior pockets)
- glasses case (in the other exterior pocket)


[The Strathmere Leather Weekend Bag](https://thestrathmere.com) is intended to pack your clothes and such for a weekend getaway, then strap it down and throw it into the trunk of your car. The [Ocean Front](https://theoceanfrontbag.com) Bag is intended to be used once you’ve arrived at your destination as your daily carry.

## Inspiration and Design

Imagine a couple strolling down to the beach from their oceanfront stay, each carrying their own Ocean Front Bag. Packed lightly with a towel, a book, and some water—just enough for comfort. The bag, whether slung over the shoulder or hanging by the side, is a perfect fit. A few grains of sand might sneak in, a small reminder of a day well spent by the sea.

This bag's simplicity is its charm. Rustic yet refined, it beckons you outdoors. It doesn't like to sit idle; it's meant for adventure, even if that adventure is just a short walk to the pool or the shore. The Ocean Front Bag transcends gender, making it a suitable companion for anyone. It's perfect for a trip to the office, a quick errand, or a leisurely coffee shop visit. Versatility is its silent strength—load it up with your essentials, and you're ready for anything, whether business or pleasure.

## Features and Functionality

- **Dual Carrying Handles:** Versatile enough to be carried by hand or over the shoulder, with a handle height of 9.75”.
- **Simple and Secure Closure:** Three 24-line button snaps provide a secure closure for the main compartment.
- **Exterior Pockets:** Two smaller pockets (8” height x 7” width) with a shared flap lid, secured by tuck-lock clasps, perfect for quick-access items. (I use these for my phone in one pocket and my glasses or sun glasses in the other pocket.)
- **Spacious Interior:** A main cavity for larger items, plus two interior pockets for organizing magazines, documents, and more. (Using mine to keep my current magazine read handy in the larger of the two, and then my wallet in the smaller. While on a trip I could see the smaller pocket being useful for keeping keys, rental fobs, and so on.)
- **Durable Construction:** Cut from a single piece of continuous leather, ensuring durability and a sleek design.

## The Essence of the Ocean Front Bag

When I look at this bag, I can hear the waves, feel the breeze, and see the seagulls soaring overhead. The warmth of the sand on my feet and the sun’s embrace come rushing back to me. These are the moments that make me feel most alive, and the Ocean Front Bag is a tangible reminder of them. It's about travel, family, love, memories, laughter, and dreams.

The Ocean Front Bag is more than just an accessory—it evokes emotion. It’s a call to adventure and a companion in everyday life, blending functionality with a sense of freedom and nostalgia. It’s a bag designed for those who cherish the journey as much as the destination.

## The Story

Every product I create has a story. Something in my life or in my mind that inspires a thing to exist. That story for _Ocean Front_ is below, is all true and from the depths of my heart.

Our family beach vacations were always the highlight of each year for me as a young husband and then as a dad. My wife at the time and I would plan the trip in January with her parents, looking for the right place, the right dates, the right price. Once the dates were set, I started a countdown on my phone. Time would crawl from that day on, each day checking to see how many days remained, wishing time to move faster. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, it was the week of the trip! At last!

I always took off work the Thursday and Friday before our Saturday check-in. Thursday to get things packed and start to unwind from work, Friday to hit the road.

We would leave Friday morning, not rushing out, but maybe around 9 or so. Leisurely. 

Our first stop was always for a sticky bun and coffee at a local stand next to the Lancaster Visitor Center just off of the highway. Enjoy those, get a few photos of our son, a toddler at this point, with the Amish Buggy, then get back on the road. Taking 896 south and eventually getting to Route 1, if my memory is correct. Just a few hours and we’d be in Dover, Delaware, pulling into the parking lot of the Air Mobility Command Museum located at the edge of Dover AFB. A tradition that I miss, as with all of this.

Seeing the static airplanes on display never got old, even though my wife and I had seen them plenty of times before. The fun part was keeping up with our son as he would run from plane to plane, amazed at the size. I remember going into one of them and they had an old fire truck _inside the airplane_. To our 3-year-old at the time, this was mind-blowing.

Next stop was our hotel for the night. We’d get there, find the room, then head to the pool. Do some swimming, then head to our first slice of Grotto’s pizza for the week. Eat dinner, enjoy the birch beer, play a few arcade games, then head back to the hotel for bed.

The next morning: breakfast at the hotel buffet, then coffee at the Starbucks just down the street. Then just an hour or so drive into the Rehoboth/Dewey Beach area of Delaware. The final stretch into town could take a while depending on traffic, so sometimes we would take a detour over to Rehoboth Beach to get some vitamin sea, other times we’d conquer the traffic and head straight to the condo rental.

(Quick aside to acknowledge that this is a lot so far. A lot for a story about a bag. And truth be told, this bag, the _Ocean Front_, was never present for any of these trips. I was not working with leather at that time, and if you told me then that I’d be doing leather work in the future, I would not have believed you. I was creative but not like that. Or so I thought.)

Her parents usually beat us there and had already done a grocery run to stock up for a few days. All we had to do was unload our car, then head up to the beach to see if the ocean was how we left it last year. It always was.

We typically stayed ocean block, but one year we did have an Ocean Front condo and I have very clear memories of staying in that particular place. The deck was my favorite, as with all of the places we’ve stayed over the years, because it was _Ocean Front_ and my view was always the ocean. The waves, I can hear them. It made for the perfect place for morning coffee, afternoon cigar, and evening wine. It was also a nice and short walk up to the beach. Not that ocean block was a long walk, but _Ocean Front_ just can’t be beat.

I digress.

And I could go on and on and on. Suffice it to say that my memories from all of these trips, easily spanning over ten years, are all positive. Sure, as with any family trip, there was drama to contend with, but I was always able to see just beyond it and enjoy each and every moment with my family. At first, it was with my girlfriend’s family, and then my fiancé’s family, and then my wife’s family - our family. We went for several years before having our son, and then he came along and we were able to include him in the traditional trip down to Dewey Beach.

Dewey Beach is not a beach to necessarily write home about, but for me it was and is. Those times are held tightly in my heart and I think about our times together often. And now even more so with the launch of this bag, the _Ocean Front_ bag.

If you are still here, still reading up to this point, you are quite dedicated, and I appreciate that very much. I have yet to take this bag to the beach, to stay ocean front with it, and use it as I have intended it to be used. That said, I am currently using it as my daily bag and as my pool bag. It is developing character with use. Drops of water have landed on it, leaving marks, making memories.

The tagline is very intentional, as all taglines should be: **Your Memories. With You.**

The idea being that this is a bag to be used. This is a bag to take to the pool. To take to the beach. To load, unload, reload, to use it for many different purposes. To create memories with, or more accurately, for it to be present while memories are being made.

And then, when the trip is over, when you return home, use it as your day-to-day bag. Pack your laptop, your paperwork, your water, your change of clothes...use it how you use any bag. And by doing so, _take your memories with you._

Now, every time I look at my _Ocean Front_, I think of my times taking it up to the pool. With my son there with me, my ex-wife joining us, spending time together by the pool - continuing to _make memories_.

I hope that I am doing an adequate job at placing the soul of this bag into the digital realm for you to read, for you to feel. This is not just another leather bag in a world that is swimming in them. This is a moment in the making, a memory in the making. This is the bag for you now, for the trip you are planning for later this year and the following. This is the bag for you to keep those memories close and to never forget them.

Get the _Ocean Front_ now and take Your Memories With You. I look forward to making one for you!

Sincerely,
